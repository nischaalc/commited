Utilizing GitHub API's *Committed* brings you a comprehensive summary of a GitHub users profile, complete with all the data that you would need to see at a glace. 

Feel free to fork the repo if you want to contribute!

**I know that [GitHub Résumé](http://resume.github.io/) pretty much does this already.**

**Default branch is `gh-pages` --- `master` will no longer be updated.**
